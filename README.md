The National Hockey League (NHL) was kind enough to provide all of the historical data on a free web interface. This library was created to parse the data that is retrieved from the api. After json data is retrieved it can be parsed by passing it to an `NHLData` python object. The documentation can be found [here](https://barbacbd.github.io/nhl/).

# Example 

In the following example, the data for a single team is retrieved.

```python
from nhl import NHLData, API_TEAM_ENDPOINT
from requests import get

json_data = get(API_TEAM_ENDPOINT).json()
if 'teams' in json_data:
    print(NHLData(json_data['teams'][0]))
```

The result is the following:

```
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "New Jersey Devils",
    "link": "/api/v1/teams/1",
    "venue": {
        "name": "Prudential Center",
        "link": "/api/v1/venues/null",
        "city": "Newark",
        "timeZone": {
            "id": "America/New_York",
            "offset": -4,
            "tz": "EDT"
        }
    },
    "abbreviation": "NJD",
    "teamName": "Devils",
    "locationName": "New Jersey",
    "firstYearOfPlay": "1982",
    "division": {
        "id": 18,
        "name": "Metropolitan",
        "nameShort": "Metro",
        "link": "/api/v1/divisions/18",
        "abbreviation": "M"
    },
    "conference": {
        "id": 6,
        "name": "Eastern",
        "link": "/api/v1/conferences/6"
    },
    "franchise": {
        "franchiseId": 23,
        "teamName": "Devils",
        "link": "/api/v1/franchises/23"
    },
    "shortName": "New Jersey",
    "officialSiteUrl": "http://www.newjerseydevils.com/",
    "franchiseId": 23,
    "active": true
}
```

The user could also access the values directly. For instance getting the `teamName` would require:

```python
print(NHLData(json_data['teams'][0].teamName))
```

The user can also access nested values:

```python
print(NHLData(json_data['teams'][0].franchise.franchiseId))
```
