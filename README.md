# NHL

The National Hockey League (NHL) was kind enough to provide all of the historical data on a free web interface. This project was created
to pull the data and analyze the data. The data is all loaded into python objects from the json encoded data that was pulled from the
NHL database.


# Database Usage

The JSON documents could be directly placed into a Non-relational Database, but it would take far more time to query the database
to receive the interested information. The python objects have a property to produce the relational database information (MYSQL).
